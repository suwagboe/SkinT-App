# SkinT
SkinT an app for customized Skin care routine.

SkinT app will allow for users to customize a shopping list of skin care products that they should use based on what they consider their problem areas to be. Users will also be able to scan the barcode of a product and determine if it will work for the issues that they currently have for their skin and if not then who should actually be using the product. The users will also have access to their profile that will list all the products that they’ve tried so that way they can actually mix their routine up. 

SkinT will have its own “skin skin guidelines” that will determine if the products are safe. Products that do not meet the criteria for skinT will appear with a warning should they have any of the following ingredients: Fragrance, Sulfates, Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, and many more harmful products. Users will be able to submit a new product that currently is not available in SkinT’s data and it can be added later after review.
